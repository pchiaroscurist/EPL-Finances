    "text": "The fortunes of a Premier League team rely heavily on their success in the transfer market, as shown in this study. Data was taken from the 2021/22 and 2022/23 Premier League tables and the site Transfermarkt. The difference in points between the teams that were in the Premier League for both seasons was then calculated, alongside their balance of transactions during the period. I then estimated a posterior probability distribution with the transfer market balance as the independent variable and the change in points as the dependent variable. It showed that if you spend like Chelsea did in the transfer market, there is a 75.9%, plus or minus 2%, chance you suffer a loss in points."

    "text": "Let’s start by asking this question. Let’s say Chelsea’s spending of 500 million euros didn’t devolve into one of the Premier League’s all-time collapses. How should it have worked out for the Blues?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create this graph, I used the rstanarm package which allowed me to create a fit using stan_glm, which gave information on the relationship between a club’s transfer balance and the points they gained or lost. Using that fit, I told the model that the club had in theory spent 500 million euros and asked it to predict the points they would gain or lose.\nBased on the last season, the model dictates that the team would lose around 10-20 points from the previous year. I was skeptical though, due to Chelsea’s season being very weird for a normal team. So I removed Chelsea from the dataset we gave the model and asked to recalculate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter removing Chelsea from consideration, it becomes more evident that based on the last season, spending big doesn’t lead to big results. The model says while Chelsea’s season was unlikely, it wasn’t improbable. The team should have points, but probably not as many as they did.\nWhat does that say about how to manage a football team? It says you shouldn’t try to spend big to build a better team. Instead, focus on selling off the players you don’t need and bringing in more talent to support your talents. Oddly enough, this is what Chelsea is doing now."

    "text": "Process\nTo start, I put the Transfermarkt data in a Google Sheet as with the skills I’ve learned so far, I was not able to get the needed data well. In the future, I want to find a way to get it directly but since it was the second table I wasn’t able to get it. I then scraped both the table for the 2021/22 and the 2022/23 Premier League seasons. The issue was, between Transfermarkt and the site I used for the tables, they spelled some of the teams differently. I had to change all ampersands to “and,” and delete all “FCs” and “AFCs.” Also from the Transfermarkt data, I created the “balance” variable which represented the total amount of money spent or gained from transfers.\nI then created an images tibble where I stored all the Premier League teams logos so they could be used in place of points. Once that was done, I merged the two standings, the financial table, and the images table. From there, I only kept the Points values from the standings, as I didn’t need the specifics of how the teams achieved their results. Once my final tibble was created, I used it as the basis of my code."
